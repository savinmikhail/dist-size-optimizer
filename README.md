# Dist Size Optimizer

A command-line tool that helps you optimize your package distribution size by automatically managing `.gitattributes` export-ignore rules.

> **Note**: This package was previously known as `export-ignore-check`. The functionality remains the same, but the name better reflects its purpose of optimizing distribution size.

## Why?

When you publish a package to Packagist, Composer creates a distribution archive using `git archive`. Files and directories that are not needed in production (like tests, documentation, CI configs) should be excluded using `.gitattributes` export-ignore to:

- Reduce package size
- Speed up installation
- Improve CI/CD pipeline performance
- Keep production packages clean

This tool helps you identify what should be excluded and can automatically fix your `.gitattributes` file.

## Installation

```bash
composer require savinmikhail/dist-size-optimizer
```

## Usage

### Check Current Project

To check your current project (recommended during development):

```bash
vendor/bin/dist-size-optimizer check
```

This will:
1. Create a git archive of your project (simulating Packagist's distribution)
2. Scan for files that should be excluded
3. Show you what to add to your `.gitattributes` file
4. Automatically append the suggested patterns to your `.gitattributes` file

> **Note**: When checking your current project, the tool uses `git archive HEAD`, which means it only includes committed changes. Make sure to commit your changes before running the check to get accurate results.

### Check Any Package

To check any package from Packagist:

```bash
vendor/bin/dist-size-optimizer check vendor/package
```

For example:
```bash
vendor/bin/dist-size-optimizer check symfony/console
```

### Output Options

#### Dry Run

By default, the tool will automatically append suggested patterns to your `.gitattributes` file. Use `--dry-run` to only see what would be added without making any changes:

```bash
vendor/bin/dist-size-optimizer check --dry-run
```

#### JSON Output

Add `--json` flag to get machine-readable output:

```bash
vendor/bin/dist-size-optimizer check --json
```

#### Custom Config

By default, the tool uses a predefined set of patterns to check. You can provide your own config file:

```bash
vendor/bin/dist-size-optimizer check --config=/path/to/config.php
# or using short option
vendor/bin/dist-size-optimizer check -c /path/to/config.php
```

The config file should be a PHP file that returns an array of patterns to check:

```php
<?php

return [
    'tests/',
    '.gitignore',
    // ... your patterns
];
```

## Example Output

```
Directories that should be excluded using export-ignore:
  â€¢ `/tests/`
  â€¢ `/docs/`
  â€¢ `/.github/`

Files that should be excluded using export-ignore:
  â€¢ `/.gitignore`
  â€¢ `/.editorconfig`
  â€¢ `/phpunit.xml.dist`
  â€¢ `/README.md`

To fix this, add the following lines to your `.gitattributes` file:
  /tests/	export-ignore
  /docs/	export-ignore
  /.github/	export-ignore
  /.gitignore	export-ignore
  /.editorconfig	export-ignore
  /phpunit.xml.dist	export-ignore
  /README.md	export-ignore

ðŸŒ¿ Your package size could be reduced by approximately 2.5 MB!
ðŸš€ This improves installation time, reduces archive size, and helps CI/CD pipelines.
